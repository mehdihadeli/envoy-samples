const desc = `
Collects cluster instance data and updates the Turbine Labs API. A variety of
service discovery backends are supported via sub-commands, each with their own
configuration options. The file collector can be used as a bridge for
unsupported backends.

By default, rotor will serve Envoy v2 xDS unless the --xds.disabled flag is set.
When configured with the --api.key flag, the Turbine Labs API will be used as
the backing store.

If no API key is provided, rotor will serve xDS in "standalone" mode
(setting the --xds.disabled flag in this context will throw an error); it will
serve a single listener on the configured port, with a virtual host named for
each collected cluster.
